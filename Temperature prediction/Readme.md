# Temperature Prediction Using Fuzzy Logic

A fuzzy logic-based system to predict the final room temperature based on current room temperature and heater power input.

## üîç Overview

This project demonstrates how fuzzy logic can be used to model real-world uncertainties for predicting room temperature. It uses the following fuzzy logic concepts:

- **Fuzzification**: Converts crisp inputs to fuzzy values
- **Rule Evaluation**: Applies human-like rules to inputs
- **Aggregation & Defuzzification**: Combines rule outputs to produce a final crisp prediction

## üìå Features

- Predicts room temperature based on fuzzy rules
- Supports **interactive** and **demonstration** modes
- Visualizes fuzzy membership functions
- Debug mode for detailed fuzzy rule activation
- Modular and extendable design
